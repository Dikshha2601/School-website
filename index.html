          Komal joined MGIS in June 2013. She has a Post Graduation degree in
          plant physiology and biochemistry and a Bachelor in Education. “My
          experience in this unique school has been very enriching for me at a
          personal as well as professional level. I have learnt a lot through
          the different projects I have been part of over the years. My favorite
          projects would be the cafe project which I did with grade 6 and
          creating eco-friendly products out of waste with grade 8. Both these
          projects were so diverse and rich in learning.” In the cafe project,
          she taught students about the cost of different products used for
          cooking, the concept of states of matter, physical and chemical
          change, digestive system, profit and loss, percentage, writing their
          own recipes, designing and writing their own menu card, making their
          own table mats using the concept of measurements etc. Learning and
          practicing life skills through this project was the best part of this
          project and the kids enjoyed being a part of this.
